  description = "We examine how trust and trustworthiness varies with the citizenship status of the alter in three democratic countries with varying sharres of immigrants and levels of economic development: the United States, South Africa, and Switzerland. Trust games were implemented in representative surveys. While we find significant differences in overall levels of trust and trustworthiness across countries, we do not find any significant differences in the degree to which participants trusted or reciprocated trust of interaction partners with the same vs. foreign citizenship status in any of the three countries. Our results suggest that citizenship status is not a salient identity marker to shape trust or trustworthiness in these types of interpersonal interactions. "

  description = "Each year, several thousand migrants from Sub-Saharan Africa die attempting to reach Europeâ€™s southern shores. Social scientists and policymakers have been puzzling over the question why so many people are prepared to take this extremely high risk of dying. Drawing on  panel data from over 10,000 individuals in The Gambia, one of the countries with the highest emigration rates in the world, we show that cultural beliefs in terms of spiritual practices are strongly associated with a decreased perception of one's own risk of dying on the migration journey. We find that consulting a healer for spiritual protection predicts migration plans and actual migration behavior."

  description = "The following pre-analysis plan describes two projects that investigate for the effect of poverty on I) prosociality, and II) political engagement. With the projects, we continue our research agenda on poverty, diversity and cooperation (Schaub, Gereke, and Baldassarri 2019). The two projects are closely linked as they draw on the same data collection effort and share the same treatment definition and some of the outcome measures. They are distinct, however, in terms of the concepts invoked. The pre-analysis plan therefore starts by. introducing common design features. After that, the outcome measures and other specificities for each project are described separately."
