  description = "Experimental economics has moved beyond the traditional focus on market mechanisms and the ‘invisible hand’ by applying sociological and socio-psychological knowledge in the study of rationality, markets, and efficiency. This knowledge includes social preferences, social norms and cross-cultural variation in motivations. In turn, the renewed interest in causation, social mechanisms and middle-range theories in sociology has led to a renaissance of research employing experimental methods. This includes laboratory experiments, but also a wide range of field experiments with diverse samples and settings. By focusing on a set of research topics that have proven to be of substantive interest to both disciplines - cooperation in social dilemmas, trust and trustworthiness, and social norms - this review aims to highlight innovative interdisciplinary research that connects experimental economics with experimental sociology. We conclude that experimental economics and experimental sociology can still learn much from each other, thus providing economists and sociologists with an opportunity to collaborate and advance our knowledge on a range of underexplored topics of interest to both disciplines."

  description = "Beliefs in magic and superstitions have been observed to influence a range of outcomes, including warfare, business and electoral choice. In the context of migration, previous studies have documented the ubiquity of superstitious beliefs in influencing when, where and how aspiring migrants decide to undertake their journeys abroad.  Building on these findings, this study empirically investigates whether magical and superstitious beliefs influence the decision to migrate using an original longitudinal data set. We do so in the context of The Gambia, which has seen some of the highest migration rates in the world in recent years. We hypothesize that magical beliefs make individuals likely to underestimate the risk of the migratory journey, and make them more trusting of smugglers, who often betray this trust. In order to test these hypotheses, we ask 10,000 potential migrants who will be re-interviewed several times during a 6-months period. This  allows us to observe actual migration decisions, and to link these to beliefs in magic, risk attitudes and trust perceptions.   "
