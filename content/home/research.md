  description = "Discrimination  against  immigrants  and  ethnic  minorities  remains  widespread  acrossEuropean countries.  While a large scholarship has documented ethno-racial discrimi-nation in institutional settings such housing and labor markets, we know little aboutwhat drives discrimination across a broader range of day-to-day encounters.  This studyreports results from a large-scale field experiment examining the physical avoidance ofimmigrants  as  an  unobtrusive  yet  important  measure  of  everyday  discrimination  inItaly.  By varying confederates’ race as well as signals of socioeconomic status (busi-ness vs. casual attire), we can additionally shed light on the mechanisms underlyingdiscriminatory patterns.  We find that natives are averse to contact with Nigerian con-federates, but do not discriminate against Chinese confederates.  Further, manipulatingconfederates’ dress to signal high socioeconomic status has little effect on natives’ be-havior.  We discuss the implications of these findings for improving interracial contactin diverse societies."

  date_start = "2020-07-23"

  description = "Beliefs in magic and superstitions have been observed to influence a range of outcomes, including warfare, business and electoral choice. In the context of migration, previous studies have documented the ubiquity of superstitious beliefs in influencing when, where and how aspiring migrants decide to undertake their journeys abroad.  Building on these findings, this study empirically investigates whether magical and superstitious beliefs influence the decision to migrate using an original longitudinal data set. We do so in the context of The Gambia, which has seen some of the highest migration rates in the world in recent years. We hypothesize that magical beliefs make individuals likely to underestimate the risk of the migratory journey, and make them more trusting of smugglers, who often betray this trust. In order to test these hypotheses, we ask 10,000 potential migrants who will be re-interviewed several times during a 6-months period. This  allows us to observe actual migration decisions, and to link these to beliefs in magic, risk attitudes and trust perceptions."

  date_start = "2020-07-23"

  description = "The following pre-analysis plan describes two projects that investigate for the effect of
poverty on I) prosociality, and II) political engagement. With the projects, we continue our
research agenda on poverty, diversity and cooperation (Schaub, Gereke, and Baldassarri
2019). The two projects are closely linked as they draw on the same data collection effort and
share the same treatment definition and some of the outcome measures. They are distinct,
however, in terms of the concepts invoked. The pre-analysis plan therefore starts by
introducing common design features. After that, the outcome measures and other specificities
for each project are described separately."
