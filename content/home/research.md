  description = "Increasing ethnic and religious diversity in many Western societies has sparked research on the consequences of this demographic change on intergroup relations. The impact of Muslim immigration in Europe has become a particularly salient topic in the political debate. Yet, it is unclear how prospective immigrant population growth and the numeric increase of Muslims impact group boundaries. We use a survey experiment to examine the effects of demographic shifts on how the majority draws group boundaries in Germany. The results show that information about a growing share of immigrants or Muslims increases perceptions of threat, leading Germans to classify ambiguous German / Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) as more likely to have a migration background. Further, such information increases negative feelings towards individuals with unambiguous MENA physical appearance. These findings contribute to a growing literature on demographic change and how group boundaries are drawn in diverse European societies."

  date_end = ""
  description = "Muslim immigrants in European societies are commonly perceived to be more religious than their Christian counterparts.  Moreover, since traditional religious beliefs and practices often run counter to modern, liberal values, Muslims' religiosity is argued to contribute to an additional ``burden" of prejudice directed at religious (but not secular) Muslims.  At the same time, could Muslims' religiosity paradoxically increase their perceived trustworthiness?  Building on evidence from recent research suggesting that religiosity functions as a costly signal of benevolent intentions, we test the hypothesis that religious Muslims are more trusted than their secular counterparts. We present evidence from a survey experiment embedded within the German Internet Panel, a random offline recruited probability sample of the general population in Germany aged 16-75, in which respondents are presented with a hypothetical ``lost wallet" scenario. Our design varies both the religious heritage (Muslim vs. Christian) and religiosity (highly religious vs. secular vs. atheist) of the wallet's finder and measure beliefs about the likelihood that the wallet will be returned."
