  description = "The Islamic headscarf is one of the most visible markers of Muslim identity, often associated with cultural difference and social exclusion in Western societies. Yet little research has examined how veiling might impact broader social perceptions of immigrant minority women, particularly in interaction with markers of high socioeconomic status. In this study, we test how the Muslim headscarf and high socioeconomic status shape natives' perceptions of trustworthiness of Turkish-origin women. We draw on a vignette experiment embedded in a nationwide survey in Germany, in which we systematically varied the presence of a headscarf (veil vs. no veil) using photo stimuli and signals of a high-status occupation (present vs. absent) presented in a hypothetical lost wallet scenario. We find that high-status cues significantly increase perceived trustworthiness for unveiled Turkish-origin women, but not for veiled women, indicating that the symbolic meanings attached to the headscarf constrain the social returns of socioeconomic attainment. Moreover, these effects are moderated by respondents’ attitudes towards Muslims. Among respondents with positive attitudes, veiled women with high-status occupation are perceived as most trustworthy, whereas among respondents with negative attitudes, higher levels of perceived trustworthiness are attributed to unveiled women with high-status occupation. Together, these findings highlight the unequal returns to status for veiled and unveiled immigrant-origin women in Germany and underscore how symbolic group boundaries and respondent attitudes shape trust judgments."

  description = "Muslims in European societies are often perceived as more religious than their Christian counterparts. Such perceptions contribute to Islamophobia rooted in  cultural conflict between Muslim traditions and liberal, secular values. Yet religiosity may also function as a beneficial signal in social exchange, communicating moral commitment and prosocial intentions. Drawing on signaling theory, this study examines whether visible expressions of Muslim religiosity foster trust in interpersonal interactions. We conducted a lab-in-the-field experiment with commuters at a German train station involving an incentivized trust game and real monetary stakes. The trustee’s identity was experimentally varied along two dimensions: (i) migration background and (ii) putative religiosity signaled through Islamic attire. Results show that Islamic religious signals increase trust toward individuals with a migration background, effectively closing the “trust gap” between trustees with and without migration background. These findings reveal how religiosity can regulate trust in intergroup exchanges, illuminating its dual role as both a boundary marker and a bridge for cooperation in diverse societies."

  description = "Does immigration-driven ethnic diversity erode support for redistribution? A key claim is that as minorities are viewed as “undeserving” welfare beneficiaries, diversity reduces support for welfare spending or fuels welfare chauvinism. Yet evidence remains mixed, partly because most studies rely on correlational data. We address this with a large pre-registered field experiment in greater Copenhagen. Supermarket shoppers were invited to sign petitions proposing either a general increase in welfare benefits or the equalization of benefits between immigrants and long-term residents. Petition materials randomly varied the ethnic appearance (Arabic vs. Nordic) of a depicted welfare-receiving family. Across more than 4,000 field observations, we find that the ethnic framing affects the willingness to increase welfare benefits, while attitudes toward equalizing benefits were largely unaffected by ethnicity. We find no consistent contextual moderation by neighborhoods. Our study offers behavioral and causal evidence on how policy framings shape redistributive behavior." +++
